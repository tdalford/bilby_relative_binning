### High-frequency detector.
Generated from Rob Ward:
9/2/2018: 'hereâ€™s a sensitivity for an aLIGO-like detector with a few non-crazy (but still possibly tough) modifications: 5% SRM, 15dB free-independent squeezing, 250W input power.  With this sensitivity, we can increase the surface loss of the test-masses by a factor of 50 to help tame parametric instabilities, but I think PI may remain the single biggest challenge'
