Plotting questions
------------------

I'm running into latex errors when :code:`bilby` tries to create plots, what should I do?

Matplotlib can be a little finicky. We wrap plotting commands in a function
which can set up the rcParams and we use environment variables to allow
configuration of this. See the docstring of this function for the allowed
configuration options


.. autofunction:: bilby.core.utils.latex_plot_format
